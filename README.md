# Hyx

🧘‍♀️Lightweight fault tolerance primitives for your modern Python microservices.

The goal of this library is to provide you with a toolkit that includes common fault tolerance patterns like:

- cache
- retries
- circuit breaker
- bulkhead
- circular buffer
- time limiter

All components are designed to work:

- in asyncio-based applications
- in-memory first

## Implementation Plan
